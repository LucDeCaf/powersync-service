# jpgwire

pgwire is a nice low-level lib that supports postgres streaming replication.

Unfortunately, it is not very mature, and we need some modifications.

We wrap the lib, and customize some parts of it here.

Additionally, this includes wrappers to connect using PowerSync config, as well as a set of standard CA certificates.
